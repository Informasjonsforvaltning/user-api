# User API

This application provides an API that provides SSO with additional information and function. It proxies user data from
Altinn, through module ```fdk-nginx-altinn-proxy```, maps external roles to associated FDK-roles and gets information
regarding FDK terms and conditions related to the users associated organizations.

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to
the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki. For more
specific context on this application, see the **IAM** subsystem section.
